# Projet-Far

This project is a messaging app written in C. It uses the TCP protocol.

The different directories refer to each session we spent working on the project. The first one is the first session, the second one is the second session and so on. Each session has its own README.md file that explains what we did during the session.

In each session, we added new features to our project.
